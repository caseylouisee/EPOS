composer global require "laravel/installer"

composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel project

However, you may wish to review the config/app.php file and its documentation. It contains several options such as timezone and locale that you may wish to change according to your application.

You may also want to configure a few additional components of Laravel, such as:

Cache
Database
Session
Once Laravel is installed, you should also configure your local environment.


php artisan serve

php artisan make:migration create_users_table

php artisan migrate
